compile-time decoding constants:
  peak height closeness threshold: 0.005V
  nominal peak height for rise calculation: 2.0V
  AGC maximum: 2

execution-time configuration:
  9 track NRZI encoding, odd parity, 0 BPI at 50 IPS
  first sample is at time 3.36362240 seconds on the tape
  sampling rate is 781,250 Hz (1.28 usec)
  peak detection window width is 8 samples (10.24 usec)
  input data order: 0(msb)1234567(lsb)p

  density was set to 800 BPI (25.00 usec/bit) after reading the first 1 blocks and seeing 9,999 transitions in 69 bins that imply 860 BPI

starting preprocessing to determine head skew...
head skew compensation after reading the first 15 blocks:
  track 0 delayed by 1 clocks (1.28 usec) based on 2438 observed flux transitions
  track 1 delayed by 2 clocks (2.56 usec) based on 9012 observed flux transitions
  track 2 delayed by 2 clocks (2.56 usec) based on 1029 observed flux transitions
  track 3 delayed by 3 clocks (3.84 usec) based on 1843 observed flux transitions
  track 4 delayed by 0 clocks (0.00 usec) based on 1590 observed flux transitions
  track 5 delayed by 3 clocks (3.84 usec) based on 2079 observed flux transitions
  track 6 delayed by 1 clocks (1.28 usec) based on 1448 observed flux transitions
  track 7 delayed by 3 clocks (3.84 usec) based on 1747 observed flux transitions
  track 8 delayed by 2 clocks (2.56 usec) based on 2266 observed flux transitions
  the earliest peak is 23.12 usec, and the latest peak is 26.90 usec
  that peak difference of 3.79 usec, and the largest standard deviation of 1.66 usec, are 15.1% and 6.6% of the nominal bit spacing
  created statistics file "results\PLAGO_beginning.peakstats_deskew.csv" from 23,452 measurements of flux transition positions

summary for file "PLAGO_beginning.tbin":
  4,481,583 samples were processed in 2 seconds (0.013 seconds/block)
  created 3 output files with a total of 122,960 bytes
  decoded 8 tape marks and 156 blocks with 122,960 bytes from 5.71 seconds of tape data
  the last block written was 8.95481344 seconds into the tape
  0 blocks had errors, 0 had warnings, 0 had mismatched tracks, 0 had bits corrected, 0 had midbit timing errors
  6 good blocks had to try more than one parmset
  parmset 0 was tried  177 times and used  171 times, or  96.6%
  parmset 1 was tried    6 times and used    0 times, or   0.0%
  parmset 2 was tried    6 times and used    0 times, or   0.0%
  parmset 3 was tried    6 times and used    0 times, or   0.0%
  parmset 4 was tried    6 times and used    6 times, or 100.0%

  created statistics file "results\PLAGO_beginning.peakstats.csv" from 321,956 measurements of flux transition positions
  to graph it from Excel, open the CSV file, then: insert chart 2D line
  the earliest peak is 24.08 usec, and the latest peak is 25.01 usec
  that peak difference of 0.92 usec, and the largest standard deviation of 1.87 usec, are 3.7% and 7.5% of the nominal bit spacing
  deskewing with delays up to 15.1% of a bit time wasn't entirely effective
  the tape might have been written by two different drives
  if so you should consider separating the data into those sections
