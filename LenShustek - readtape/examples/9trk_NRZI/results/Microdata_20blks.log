compile-time decoding constants:
  peak height closeness threshold: 0.005V
  nominal peak height for rise calculation: 2.0V
  AGC maximum: 2

execution-time configuration:
  9 track NRZI encoding, odd parity, 0 BPI at 50 IPS
  first sample is at time 7.45257088 seconds on the tape
  sampling rate is 781,250 Hz (1.28 usec)
  peak detection window width is 8 samples (10.24 usec)
  input data order: 0(msb)1234567(lsb)p

  density was set to 800 BPI (25.00 usec/bit) after reading the first 1 blocks and seeing 9,999 transitions in 62 bins that imply 825 BPI

summary for file "Microdata_20blks.tbin":
  414,517 samples were processed in 1 seconds (0.050 seconds/block)
  created 1 output file with a total of 10,240 bytes
  decoded 0 tape marks and 20 blocks with 10,240 bytes from 0.50 seconds of tape data
  the last block written was 7.98312192 seconds into the tape
  0 blocks had errors, 0 had warnings, 0 had mismatched tracks, 0 had bits corrected, 0 had midbit timing errors
  0 good blocks had to try more than one parmset
  parmset 0 was tried   20 times and used   20 times, or 100.0%

  created statistics file "results\Microdata_20blks.peakstats.csv" from 37,127 measurements of flux transition positions
  to graph it from Excel, open the CSV file, then: insert chart 2D line
  the earliest peak is 24.30 usec, and the latest peak is 26.06 usec
  that peak difference of 1.75 usec, and the largest standard deviation of 1.58 usec, are 7.0% and 6.3% of the nominal bit spacing
  head skew is significant; you should try again with the -deskew option
